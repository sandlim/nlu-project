\section{Introduction}
You can keep this short. Ideally you introduce the task already in a way that highlights the difficulties  your method will tackle.

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Generating wrong endings}
Wrong endings were generated for each story to better train our classifier. Naive way would be to randomize the correct endings of each story. However, doing so would obviously change the main charecter or main point of the story. Therefore, we needed to generate endings that are wrong but still preserves narrative structure. Negation of the fifth sentence was a promising way to achieve that end. i.e. The resulting sentence would be contain at least one of the charecters of the story. The resulting sentence would still be generally realisitic, except that it would not create a meaningful story as an addition to the previous four sentences.

Negation can be challenging for complex sentence structures because we would have to decide which part of the sentence to negate. For example, the sentence: "
Kelly quickly went home." There are two possibilities of negation: "Kelly slowly went home", "Kelly did not quickly go home". If we do not keep track the number of negations in the sentence, the result would be "Kelly did not slowly go home". Hence, our approach was to first negate the adjectives and adverbs, and in their absence, negate the verbs, all the while keeping count of number of negations in the generated sentence.
