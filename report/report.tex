\section{Introduction}
You can keep this short. Ideally you introduce the task already in a way that highlights the difficulties  your method will tackle.

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Generating wrong endings}
Wrong endings were generated for each story to better train our classifier. Naive way would be to randomize the correct endings of each story. However, doing so would obviously change the main charecter or main point of the story. Therefore, we needed to generate endings that are wrong but still preserves narrative structure. Negation of the fifth sentence was a promising way to achieve that end. i.e. The resulting sentence would be contain at least one of the charecters of the story. The resulting sentence would still be generally realisitic, except that it would not create a meaningful story as an addition to the previous four sentences.

Negation can be challenging when we have more complex sentence structures. For example,

Even if you change this to John did not fix the vase that he broke, there is a presupposition that there is a vase and that John broke it.

Similarly, simply negating the sentence John did not stopped using drugs as John stopped using drugs still conveys that John, at one point, used drugs. A more thorough negation would be John never used drugs.

\section{Model}
The math/architecture of your model. This should formally describe your idea from above. If you really want to, you can merge the two sections.
\section{Training}
What is your objective? How do you optimize it?

\section{Experiments}
This {\bf must} at least include the accuracy of your method on the validation set.
\section{Conclusion}
You can keep this short, too.
